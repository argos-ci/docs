# Storybook Quickstart

Learn how to setup visual testing in a Storybook using Argos.

The best way to integrate Argos with Storybook is to use [Storycap](https://github.com/reg-viz/storycap) to crawl your Storybook and capture screenshots of your components.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:

- [Use Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/install)
- [Create your project in Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com/new)

## 1. Install

<InstallDevDep dependency="@argos-ci/cli storycap" showCliLink />

## 2. Capture screenshots

There are two ways to capture screenshots of your Storybook:

- If your Storybook is running and accessible via an URL, add this command to your CI pipeline to capture screenshots of your stories:

```sh
# Capture screenshots of your stories
npm exec -- storycap <STORYBOOK-URL> --outDir ./screenshots
```

- If your Storybook is not deployed, you need to serve your Storybook before capturing the screenshots. Use the following commands:

```sh
# Build Storybook
npm exec -- storybook build --output-dir ./storybook-static

# Screenshot Storybook with Storycap
npm exec -- storycap --serverCmd "npx http-server ./storybook-static --port 6006" http://127.0.0.1:6006/ --outDir ./screenshots
```

Read the [Storycap documentation](https://github.com/reg-viz/storycap) to learn more about the installation and advanced usages.
