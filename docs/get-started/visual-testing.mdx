# Visual testing

Visual testing is the process of comparing application UI with the results expected by design or with the previous state of the application. Automated visual testing tools, like Argos, allow monitoring of the application's UI on multiple browsers and screen sizes.

Argos visual testing is based on screenshots comparison changes detection and manual review. With this process, developers can check the visual impacts of their pull requests in a few seconds, even on a big application.

## Visual changes detection

Once the [installation](/installation) is done, Argos will receive your application's screenshots when you create a pull request or merge a commit to the repository [reference branch](#reference-branch-definition).

Argos compares the screenshots with their baseline counterpart. If a visual change is detected, a red check status is added to the GitHub pull request, and a green check is if they are stable.

<img src={githubCommitStatus} alt="GitHub commit status" className="rounded" />

> Click on the **"Details"** link to review the visual changes.

## Reviewing visual changes

The visual changes review takes place on the Argos application.

#### Argos build example

<img
  src={buildExample}
  alt="Example build"
  style={{ borderRadius: 8, marginBottom: 10 }}
/>

Navigate through the screenshot diffs by clicking on the sidebar, the navigation buttons, or using your keyboard.

> Tip: Press `?` to show all available keyboard shortcuts.

The side-by-side UI is designed to quickly spots visual changes and verify that screenshots match their expected results.

#### Reject a build workflow

If you spot a visual bug or if a screenshot doesn't satisfy your expectations, click on the "Review changes" button and select "Reject changes." The build status becomes "Changes rejected", and GitHub is notified of the rejection.

After rejecting the change, commit a new version to fix it.

#### Approve a build workflow

When screenshots match the expected results, click on the "Review changes" button, then select "Approve changes". The build status becomes "Changes approved", and GitHub is notified of the approval.

Once the changes are accepted, you can confidently merge your pull request.
