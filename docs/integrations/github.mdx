# GitHub Integration

Seamlessly integrate Argos with GitHub for automated visual testing directly within your workflow. Connect Argos to your repositories and receive instant feedback on your pull requests, making it easier to maintain visual consistency across your project.

## Why Argos needs repository access

Argos analyzes commit history to choose the right [baseline build](/baseline-build) and posts commit statuses or pull request comments. Granting repository access lets Argos read commits, find merge bases, and report build results back to GitHub.

## GitHub Connect

Use GitHub Connect to log in to Argos with your GitHub account. This integration allows Argos to access your repositories and streamline the setup process.

## Argos' GitHub App

Argos provides a dedicated GitHub App that connects directly to your repositories, enabling real-time visual testing feedback on pull requests.

- **Actions** — used to allow tokenless authentication

We take your security and privacy seriously. If you have any concerns or questions, please [contact us](/contact-us).
