# GitHub Enterprise Integration

## GitHub Enterprise Cloud

GitHub Enterprise Cloud is supported out of the box.

You can configure Argos exactly like GitHub.com by following the standard GitHub App setup documented in the [GitHub guide](/github). No additional configuration is required on the Argos side.

## GitHub Enterprise Server self-hosted

GitHub Enterprise Server self-hosted deployments require specific configuration.

We support GitHub Enterprise Server as part of our Enterprise plan, which includes SAML SSO and other advanced features. To upgrade to Enterprise, [contact sales](mailto:contact@argos-ci.com).
