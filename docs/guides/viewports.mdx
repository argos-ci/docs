# Configuring Responsive Viewports

Argos lets you capture the same page at multiple breakpoints with a single test. Configure viewports once and get consistent responsive coverage across Playwright, Cypress and Puppeteer.

## Prerequisites

This advanced feature integrates smoothly with [Playwright](/playwright), [Cypress](/cypress), and [Puppeteer](/puppeteer) to enhance your testing capabilities.

This feature works seamlessly with [Playwright](/playwright), [Cypress](/cypress) and [Puppeteer](/puppeteer).

## Viewport Configuration

Pass a viewports array to `argosScreenshot()` to generate screenshots for each dimension or preset you define. You can mix explicit sizes and device presets.

```js
await argosScreenshot(..., {
  viewports: [
    "iphone-4",
    { width: 800, height: 600 },
    { preset: "ipad-2", orientation: "landscape" },
  ],
});
```

## Available Presets

| ------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| macbook-16    | 1536       | 960         |
| macbook-15    | 1440       | 900         |

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

Many sites compute layout at load time and will not adapt cleanly if the viewport changes later. If you notice issues, you may want to run your test suite entirely for each viewport instead of changing the viewport before taking each screenshot.

For example, in Playwright you can create a separate browser context for each viewport size.

```ts title="playrwight.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium-mobile",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        channel: "chrome",
      },
    },
    {
      name: "chromium-mobile",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        channel: "chrome",
        viewport: { width: 402, height: 874 }, // iPhone 7 viewport
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

You can also run `page.setViewportSize()` before navigating to the page to ensure the layout is computed correctly.

```ts
await page.setViewportSize({
  width: 640,
  height: 480,
});
await page.goto("https://example.com");
```
