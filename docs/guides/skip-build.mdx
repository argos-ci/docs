# Skipping a Build

Sometimes you want Argos to report success without running visual tests.  
This is useful when Argos is configured as a required GitHub status check, but you intentionally want to skip screenshots for a commit or pull request.

A skipped build:

- uploads no screenshots
- runs no visual comparison
- immediately marks the commit status as success

## Creating a skipped build

You can skip a build in two ways.

### Environment variable

Set the environment variable `ARGOS_SKIPPED` to `"true"` in your CI configuration.

**GitHub Actions example:**

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
jobs:
  visual-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run visual-tests # or your test command
        env:
          ARGOS_SKIPPED: "true"
```

This reports a successful Argos check without uploading screenshots.

### Using the CLI

You can also explicitly create a skipped build using the CLI.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
jobs:
  visual-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
      - name: Skip Argos build
        run: npx @argos-ci/cli skip
```

This immediately creates a successful Argos build with no visual testing.
