# Tests Dashboard

The Tests dashboard gives you a project-wide view of test stability. It lists all tests sorted by flakiness score so the most flaky tests show up first.

_A project Tests dashboard with flakiness metrics_

## Open the dashboard

1. Open your project in Argos.
2. Click the **Tests** tab.

## How tests are ranked

Tests are sorted by **flakiness score** (descending). The tests at the top are the most flaky.

## Columns explained

- **Test**: The latest screenshot uploaded for the test, the test name, and the build name.
- **Last change**: The most recent change detected on an auto-approved build during the selected period.
- **Flakiness**: A score that summarizes how flaky a test is based on its stability and consistency.
- **Changes**: The number of changes detected for the test during the selected period.
- **Stability**: The ratio of changes to total reference builds. A lower stability rate means the test is more likely to be flaky.
- **Consistency**: The ratio of one-off changes to total changes. A lower consistency rate means the test is more likely to be flaky.

## Filter and time range

- Filter tests by **build name** to focus on a subset of runs.
- Choose a **time period** to control which changes and scores are included.

## Open a test page

Click any row to open the detailed test page and review history and stability details. See [Flaky Test Detection](/flaky-test-detection) for more information.
