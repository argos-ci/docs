# Capture Screenshots from URLs

Efficiently capture web page screenshots across frameworks with Argos: A step-by-step guide for Playwright, Cypress, and Puppeteer integration.

## Using Playwright

Below is a step-by-step script for Playwright to take screenshots of specified pages. This script utilizes the Argos Playwright integration for streamlined screenshot capture:

```js title="screenshot-pages.spec.ts"
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";

const pages = [
  { name: "homepage", path: "/" },
  { name: "integrations", path: "/integrations" },
  { name: "contact", path: "/contact-us" },
  { name: "pricing", path: "/pricing" },
];

for (const { name, path } of pages) {
  test(`Run Argos on ${name} (${path})`, async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(path);
    await argosScreenshot(page, name);
  });
}
```

## Using Cypress

Here's how you can capture screenshots within Cypress. The script navigates to each page and uses the Argos Cypress command for screenshots:

```js title="screenshot-pages.spec.ts"
const pages = [
  { name: "homepage", path: "/" },
  { name: "integrations", path: "/integrations" },
  { name: "contact", path: "/contact-us" },
  { name: "pricing", path: "/pricing" },
];

for (const { name, path } of pages) {
  it(`Run Argos on ${name} (${path})`, () => {
    cy.visit(path);
    cy.argosScreenshot(name);
  });
}
```

## Using Puppeteer

or Puppeteer users, this script demonstrates how to capture page screenshots effectively. It employs Puppeteer for navigation and screenshot capture:

```js title="screenshot-pages.spec.ts"
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/puppeteer";

const baseUrl = "http://localhost:3000";
const pages = [
  { name: "homepage", path: "/" },
  { name: "integrations", path: "/integrations" },
  { name: "contact", path: "/contact-us" },
  { name: "pricing", path: "/pricing" },
];

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  for (const { name, path } of pages) {
    await page.goto(`${baseUrl}${path}`);
    await page.screenshot({ path: `${name}.png` });
  }

  await browser.close();
})();
```
