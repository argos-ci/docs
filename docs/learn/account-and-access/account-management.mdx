# Account Management

When you sign up for Argos, you create an account that manages your projects and subscriptions.  
Argos offers three types of plans:

- [Hobby](/pricing-plans#hobby-plan)
- [Pro](/pricing-plans#pro-plan)
- [Enterprise](/pricing-plans#enterprise-plan)

Each plan provides different features and resources to match your needs.

You can sign up with **Google**, **GitHub**, or **GitLab**.

## Signing up with a Git provider

Argos supports the following Git providers:

- [GitHub](/github)
- [GitLab](/gitlab)

When you sign up, you’ll be asked to authorize Argos to access your Git provider.  
This connection becomes your default login method.

After signing up, you can manage login methods in your **Personal Settings**.

1. Select your profile picture in the top-right corner of the dashboard.

Your team administrator must configure this option. To upgrade to Enterprise, [contact sales](https://argos-ci.com/contact).

### Choosing a connection when creating a project

When you create your first project, you’ll be asked to connect a Git provider.  
This connection is required and will also serve as a login method.

## Resolving "Account already attached" issues

If you see the error message:

> **Your _GitHub|GitLab|Google_ account is already linked to another Argos account**

it means the provider account you are trying to connect is already associated with a different Argos account.

### Steps to fix

1. **Log out of Argos**
   - Select your avatar in the top-right corner, then select **Log out**.

2. **Log back in with your provider**
   - From the login page, choose **Continue with _GitHub|GitLab|Google_**.
   - This will sign you into the Argos account that currently owns your provider link.

3. **Disconnect or delete the account**
   - Once logged in, select your avatar in the top-right corner, choose **Settings**.
   - Select **Authentication** from the sidebar.
   - Find the _GitHub|GitLab|Google_ connection, select the vertical ellipsis (⋮), and select **Disconnect**.
   - Alternatively, if the account is no longer needed, you can delete it entirely from **Account Settings → General**.

4. **Log out again**
   - Return to the login page.

5. **Reconnect with the right account**
   - Log back in with the account you want to use.
   - From **Account Settings → Connections**, link your provider account.

After completing these steps, your provider account will be linked to the correct Argos account.
