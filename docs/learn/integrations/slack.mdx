# Slack Integration

Argos integrates with Slack to keep your team aligned on visual changes and reviews.  
It sends notifications and also unfurls Argos build URLs directly inside Slack.

:::note
Slack integration is available on Pro and Enterprise plans
:::

## What you get

- Automatic Slack notifications when builds are created, reviewed, approved, or rejected
- Rich previews when pasting an Argos build URL in Slack
- Fine grained control using Automations conditions

## Slack notifications

Use Automations to post messages in the right channels at the right time.

Typical signals you may want to route to Slack:

- A build is ready for review
- Changes are requested
- A build is auto approved on main
- Only failed or blocking builds

Notifications include build status, branch, author, and a direct link to the build.

## URL unfurling in Slack

When you paste an Argos build URL into Slack, Argos automatically unfurls it.

The preview includes:

- Build status and outcome
- Project and branch
- Direct shortcut to open the build in Argos

This works in messages, threads, and shared links, which makes reviews and handoffs easier without extra clicks.

## Set up Slack integration

Set up a Slack integration to unfurl Argos build URLs.

1. Verify that you have selected the correct team in the top, if not click the double arrow icon to select the right team.
2. Go to the team’s **Settings** tab.
3. Select the **Integrations** section.
4. Click on **Connect to Slack**.

## Set up Slack notifications

Set up a Slack notification rule using Argos automations.

1. Select a project in your Argos team.
2. Go to the **Automations** tab in your Argos project and click on **New Automation**.
3. Name your automation, e.g., "Notify Slack on build completion".
4. Under **WHEN**, select one or several events that will trigger the notification.
5. (Optional) Under **IF**, add conditions such as "Build type is check".

   <img
     src={automationConditions}
     alt="Automation conditions example"
     className="rounded"
     style={{ marginBottom: 30, marginTop: 0, paddingTop: 0, width: 600 }}
   />

6. Under **THEN**, choose the action **Send notification to Slack**.

   If this is your first time using Slack with Argos, click **Connect to Slack** and follow the connection flow.

7. Select the Slack channel and optionally provide the channel ID.

     src={slackChannelId}

9. Click **Create Rule** to activate it.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

- For private channels, manually invite the bot with `/invite @Argos`.
- Only Argos team admins can configure Slack integrations.
- You can test notifications anytime using **Send test notification**.
