# Builds list

The Builds list is the main view for tracking every Argos build in a project. It helps you scan status, drill into a specific build, and filter down to exactly the runs you care about.

## Open the Builds list

1. Open your project in Argos.
2. Click the **Builds** tab.

## What each row shows

Each row represents a single build and typically includes:

- **Build ID** and status (for example: Auto-approved, Approved, Changes detected, or Rejected).
- **Change counts** for the build (changes, additions, and removals when applicable).
- **Pull request metadata** when the build is linked to a PR.
- **Branch and commit** information.
- **Timestamp** for when the build was created.

## Filters

Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow the list:

- **Type**: Filter by build category (for example: check, orphan, or auto-approved builds).
- **Status**: Filter by review state (for example: approved, changes detected, or rejected).
- **Build name**: Filter to a specific build name when your CI splits builds (see [Build splitting](/build-splitting)).

Build names in the filter are sourced from builds created in the **last month**. Builds can't be deleted, but unused build names drop out of the filter list after about a month of inactivity.

## FAQ

**Can I delete a build?**
No. Builds are immutable records and cannot be deleted.

**Why did a build name disappear from the filter?**
The build name list only includes names used in builds created within the last month. If a build name has no recent activity, it will no longer appear.
